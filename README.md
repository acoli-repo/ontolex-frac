# ontolex-frac
Working draft of an OntoLex module for FRequency, Attestations and Corpus data. This page can be seen at https://acoli-repo.github.io/ontolex-frac/ .

Note: As of 2020-04-03, FrAC development is formally conducted in a clone of this repository under the OntoLex organization at GitHub. It's current state remains here for archiving purposes and for compatibility with earlier publications. It is expected to be removed in the mid-perspective, and will not be maintained anymore. Please use https://github.com/ontolex/frequency-attestation-corpus-information, instead.

[comment]: (See https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Frequency,_Attestation_and_Corpus_Information for the discussions on and behind this draft within the W3C Ontolex community group.)
